\section{Background}
A retro computing or a retro revival project is a computing project that is in some way inspired or derived from a home computer the was released between 1975 and 1990. This period is referred to as the early home computer era and it was the first time computers where specifically marketed for personal use within the home. This lead to many people having their first interaction with a computer during this period. Many people whom lived through this period have strong memories of the products they used, such as the Commodore 64, the ZX Spectrum and the BBC Micro. For various reasons, many people have tried, with varying amounts of success, to revive certain computer systems from the period, either by emulating the system in software on a more powerful computer or rebuilding the physical circuitry. Some retro computing projects have been inspired by the home computers of the period being less complex and having less abstraction between the user and the mechanics of the computer. The MEGA65 is a retro computing project which is currently under development and which aims to innovate the never-released Commodore 65. 


\section{Scope of thesis}
This thesis aims to provide a body of knowledge on the process as well as the challenges and risks associated with a retro computing project which is trying to bring a new product to the market.


\section{Current situation and how it can be improved}
Many retro computing projects have brought products to the market, with varying amounts of success. The C64 Mini is a Commodore 64-inspired game console which is available for purchase from retail outlets within Australia and other countries. It received satisfactory reviews and can be considered a successful project by many metrics. Comparatively, the Vega Plus, a hand-held game console inspired by the Spectrum ZX was an abject failure in regard to project outcomes for stakeholders. The widely varying processes and methods employed by differing projects suggests the outcomes may be more consistent and improved if a more rigorous process was followed. There is currently no body of knowledge specific to retro computer projects and the productization process. If a body of knowledge could be formed, it should allow future projects to achieve a more consistent outcome. This thesis aims to be the start point for that body of knowledge and it is hoped further research will follow. Part of this thesis is to highlight the common challenges and risks that retro projects are likely to be exposed to, which should allow retro projects to be evaluated against aforementioned risks. With a risk evaluation undertaken and the high risk areas identified, the retro project should be able to determine and enact strategies to reduce their risk exposure, this should then have the effect of improving the outcomes of the project.


\section{Research questions}
The questions this thesis aims to answer are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item What does the retro computing revival project productization process look like?
\item What risk and challenges are associated with a retro computing revival project?
\item What is the MEGA65 project? 
\item How exposed to risks is the MEGA65 project July 2018?
\item What can be done to reduce the MEGA65 project's risks?
\item Did the MEGA65 project reduce its risk after 10 months?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hypothesis}
It is hypothesised that the body of knowledge created, which includes a definition of the process to productization of a retro computing project as well as its associated risks and challenges, will allow future retro computing projects achieve more desirable outcomes more consistently.

\section{Methodology}
To answer the research questions and produce a body of knowledge, the following method was followed. First an in depth case study was conducted into several retro computing projects. Because there is a lack of peer-reviewed sources for this information, a majority of it was sourced from websites and other publications. From these case studies a process was distilled and recorded. The challenges that beset each project are recorded and categorised into risks. As a way to establish the quality of the risks ascertained, a retro computing project is evaluated against the aforementioned risks. This project, called MEGA65, is a retro computing project which is currently in development, making it an ideal candidate to evaluate. MEGA65 is evaluated for risks twice, the two evaluation take place ten months apart. After the first evaluation the MEGA65 project is provided with advice and strategies on how to reduce their risk exposure in the areas identified as high risk in the evaluation. After ten months the MEGA65 project is evaluated again and the results compared to determine if the MEGA65 project's risk expose has changed. To evaluate the MEGA65 project effectively, it first needed to be understood, this process involved researching the state of the MEGA65 project in July 2018 as well as researching the intended products to be released by the MEGA65 project. The products MEGA65 intends to release are captured with a use case study which looks at ways the users will interact with the products. To understand the state of the MEGA65 and create a a snapshot in time of its development, most of the information is conveyed via conversations with the MEGA65 team members. This is due to the nature of the development process not allowing time for documentation to be created by the team members.
