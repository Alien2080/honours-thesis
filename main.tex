\begin{abstract}

  The children who grew up through the home computer revolution of the 1980s are now
  established in life, and frequently willing to invest time and money in projects and products that have nostaligic
  value for them.  This includes retro-computing projects that re-create the iconic
  home computers of the 1980s and early 1990s.
  There have been a number of community and commercially driven retro-computing projects,
  such as the Spectrum Next, Spectrum Vega, the C64mini, the C64DTV, the Ultimate64 among
  many others. The scope and ambition of these projects varies, as has their success.
  Some, like the C64DTV were commercial successes, while others, such as the Spectrum
  Vega are suffering long drawn out deaths due to a variety of problems or misadventures.
  The purpose of this research is to examine a number of these as case-studies, and to
  learn from them, so that other such projects can have an increased likelihood of success,
  and the participants can avoid some of the more unpleasant misadventures that have arisen,
  especially those involving hostile laywers.
  This thesis acts to document the steps and stages of productisation and market release for
  such projects, and then applies these learnings directly to the MEGA65 retro-computing
  project at Flinders University, to accelerate its approach to market, and to help it avoid
  the pitfalls of past failures.  The learnings presented in this thesis are designed to be
  of use to any retro-computing project, and it is our hope that it will enable other
  projects to also have greater success, and less pain in the process.
